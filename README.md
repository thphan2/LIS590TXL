# LIS590TXL Final Project
The project aims to evaluate classification performance of different supervised methods in detecting emotion.
It contains three parts:
1) Built classifiers for three different collections ISEAR databank, SemEval 2007 and Affected data by Celicia Alm using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM and Decision Tree classification methods.
2) Compared the classification accuracy among those supervised methods and examined the performance with and without using Dimensionality Reduction (SVD).
3) Applied the highest accuracy classifier to detect emotion in stories from Human of New York website.
